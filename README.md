# Parallax-Website
Welcome to the Parallax Website repository! This project showcases a modern web design technique called parallax scrolling, where background images move at a different speed than the foreground content, creating an immersive and visually stunning experience. This project is perfect for demonstrating front-end development skills using HTML and CSS.
